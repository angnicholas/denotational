1. Monotone Functions



2. Continuous Functions

    - For the rationals ordered by the usual â‰¤ relation, what is the least upper bound (lub) of the sequence $$S_n = 1 - 2^{-n} = 1 \leq \frac{1}{2} \leq \frac{3}{4} \leq \frac{7}{8} ...$$?
    
    - Prove it.

    Consider the following piecewise unit step function:
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{if } x < 1 \\
      1 & \text{if } x \geq 1
    \end{cases}
    $$

    - Write down the value of $$lub f(S_n)$$ and $$f lub S_n$$. What does this say about the continuity of f(x)?

    - Consider the mapping of longitudes and latitudes to the x-y coordinates on a paper map. In what ways is this continuous? In what ways is it not continuous? 

3. Consider the following functions. Draw a diagram (or describe) the partial order relationship between them.

4. Consider the following algorithm (pick one of the parsing / compiler algos)

Use Kleene's Theorem to prove that the algorithm terminates, at the correct answer.

- What is the ordering of states?
- What is the least element?
- What is the function that maps a state to another?
- What process generates the lfp?

5. Use Kleene's Theorem to derive an algorithm to compute (give an algorithm)

6. Something about Scott's induction principle

7. Some more stuff on constructions with domains, practical examples

8. Idk
